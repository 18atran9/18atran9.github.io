    Hello! My name is Andy Tran and I am currently a student at La Quinta High School. After high school I would like to attend Cal State Fullerston or UCSD to major in computer science. I am also on the boys varsity track and field team at La Quinta. I am in the high jump event and am currently the league champion. I would also like to be competing in NCAA meets in college for the high jump. For fun, I would play video games or watch a lot of YouTube videos. My goals in life are to make it to the Olympics, and to have an enjoyable job so that life wouldn't be boring.
