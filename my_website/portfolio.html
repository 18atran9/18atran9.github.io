    <h5>Reflection</h5>
    <p>
        When Brandon and I were making City Breakout, we did a lot of trial and error to figure out
        the best way to make the game execute. Our biggest issues was for the ball to bounce off of the paddle. We had to make the ball
        change its direction on impact with the paddle sprite. There was a lot of issues with this. The ball
        would either hit the paddle or it would go straight through it. Secondly, the ball would sometimes bounce into
        an awkward angle where it would infinitely bounce left to right and never hit a block. We countered these issues by
        altering the degrees in which the ball would bounce off of the paddle. After we solved that issue, we went on to create the real
        aesthetic design of the game and one of the effects I like the most is the disintergrating blocks. We simply create a script
        where when the ball hits the block, it would switch through several costumes to show the effect of breaking apart. Overall, I think our game
        was a successful take on Atari Breakout and both Brandon and I are proud of it.

    <p>In this story, we meet a boy who has recently graduated from high school. He makes either the decision to go to college or take a break year. His ultimate destiny is determined by the player's choices.</p>
    </p>
    <p>To make this story, Tommy and I used multiple if/elif/else statements to help accomodate the user's raw_input.
    If the user did not choose one of the listed choices, we would send them back to the prompt again with the same choices until they choose what is listed.</p>
    <p>During the production of our interactive story we did not find any problems besides grammatical errors. </p>
    <p>The creation of this story is one of the reason's that I wanted to take this class because I wanted to be able to create a digital work or interactive entertainment.</p>
    <p>One particular story that I liked was Brandon senior's story because I like RPG games and he included a health system to make decisions more thought about.</p>
    <p>If I had a chance to do this all over again I would keep my endings sad and I would make the story longer.</p>
